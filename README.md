────୨ৎ──── > your very much likely viewing this github from my dear and lovely friend, seawatt / zam . no seawatt is NOT my girlfriend. i have a irl girlfriend. 

꧁⎝ 𓆩༺✧༻𓆪 ⎠꧂ ⤷ ゛ ˎˊ˗ my introduction may be difficult to read, i apologize. i have not decorated my readme in awhile.


ᡕᠵデᡁ᠊╾━ - - i prefer to go by anastasia or oscar / arvid, your choice whether to call me one or the other. i am not a kin of oscar piastri. I am not a kin of Arvid Lindblad or Liam Lawson Either. I am not a shifter.

I am neurodivergent, I am open to say this because i am deadass not scared of some people on a pony game.

⏔⏔⏔ ꒰ ᧔ෆ᧓ ꒱ ⏔⏔⏔ > yes , i am a female formula one fan. its not a suprise. ive been a fan of oscar piastri since his formula renault days, and will still continue to be a fan of him. do not interact with me if your toxic towards female f1 fans. Ive been a fan of Arvid Lindblad since his F4 Days. Recently became a fan of Liam Lawson.

𓊆ྀི❤︎𓊇ྀི > i do NOT give two shits about max verstappens's wdc titles. he is a driver, not a god. its not the end of the world if max verstappen loses a title.

---> my pc is broken so you wont be seeing me on ponytown until i get a new one.
